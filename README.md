This is our project in regarding planting trees.
The user can plant trees.
Some trees are for free.
Others are to be paid.
There are 3 django projects.
And 1 vue (quasar) project.
We have used quasar, a css framework of vuejs 3.
We have used django rest framework and for payment we have used Stripe.


If downloading our project you should add some dependencies.

The first django project works with login and register integrated with vuejs (quasar).

The second django project named new will handle the image uploading.
The images will be received in the front end and posted to the backend.
The user interface used is quasar.

The code used here is option API.
The UI design will be good for the vue as
